## Please read -- recent changes to our repo
On October 2, 2022, [we removed some bloat from our repository](https://github.com/dataplat/dbatools/issues/8542). This change requires that all contributors reclone or reset their repo using the following code:

```
git fetch
git reset --hard origin/master
```

You can also just delete your dbatools directory and have GitHub Desktop reclone it.

 - [ ] Please confirm you have the smaller repo (110MB .git directory vs 275MB .git directory)

 Note this will likely have to happen once more in the future as we move the SMO and c# library to their own repository.
