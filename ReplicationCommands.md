## How to run pester tests locally

```PowerShell
 # run this against fresh containers to setup replication as it would be in gh action
 #.\bin\Replication\Invoke-ReplicationSetup.ps1
 # commented out

 #run the tests -Show All will caus
 invoke-pester .\tests\gh-actions-repl.ps1

```

## Testing

Some additional scenarios for us to test commands against.

- how the commands work when we have a "third site" involved , i mean if  we have the distribution db not on the Publication-Server and not on the Subscriber-Server (thats not so common, but it is a thing imo) - I saw some unusual behaviour with replcation commands when the setup is with a seperate Distribution-DB-Server.

## Questions

- Should parameter be `PublicationType` or `Type` and `PublicationName` or `Name`
